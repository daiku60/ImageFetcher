# Image Fetcher

in order to be able to run this example, you should have a Getty Images API Key,
and you must create a file named apikey.plist with the following content:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>ApiKey</key>
	<string>(YOUR_GETTY_API_KEY_HERE)</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```
